//! Deterministic crash injection for the kill-and-replay proof.
//!
//! A [`CrashPoint`] names a precise spot in the run where the process must
//! die — modelling a `kill -9` at exactly the window the exactly-once
//! guarantee has to survive. Injection is a real [`std::process::abort`]
//! (SIGABRT, no unwinding, no destructors, no flush) so the on-disk journal
//! is left in exactly the state a hard kill would leave it.
