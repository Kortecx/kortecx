/// Per-tool declared idempotency mechanism (D38 §2). Drives the executor's
/// dispatch protocol selection for WORLD-MUTATING tools. The tool author
/// declares this at registration; the executor reads it at dispatch.
///
/// **No `Default` impl** — the field is required on every `ToolDef`. A
/// silent default is exactly how a token-less WM tool ends up mis-classified
/// as something safer, which is the failure D38 §2c exists to prevent. Every
/// tool MUST declare its class explicitly.
///
/// # Variant scopes
///
/// - [`Token`](Self::Token) — the tool accepts idempotency tokens (D38 §1).
///   The broker sets `EffectRequest.idempotency_key = mote.id.to_hex()`; the
///   remote API's idempotency contract backstops the effect→commit window.
/// - [`Readback`](Self::Readback) — the tool supports deterministic
///   read-back (D38 §2a). The executor probes world state keyed on `MoteId`
///   before dispatch; skips if already applied. Probe is deterministic;
///   never a model call. Naturally suits **read-only tools** where the
///   dispatch IS the probe.
/// - [`Staged`](Self::Staged) — the tool requires staged-intent journaling
///   (D38 §2b), and this is **ENFORCED at runtime**: `kx-journal` carries the
///   `EffectStaged` entry kind, `kx-executor`'s commit protocol runs
///   `append(EffectStaged) → dispatch → verify → Committed`, and lifecycle
///   recovery de-duplicates a staged-but-uncommitted effect on replay rather
///   than blindly re-dispatching it.
/// - [`AtLeastOnce`](Self::AtLeastOnce) — the tool has no closing mechanism
///   (D38 §2c). The executor refuses to dispatch it unless the workflow
///   submission context's `accept_at_least_once` is `true` (per
///   `docs/design/workflow-submission.md` — submission-spec, NOT warrant).
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// use kx_tool_registry::IdempotencyClass;
/// // All four variants exist and are inequal — the field is enum-shaped
/// // to make mis-classification a compile-time / serialization error.
/// assert_ne!(IdempotencyClass::Token, IdempotencyClass::Readback);
/// assert_ne!(IdempotencyClass::Staged, IdempotencyClass::AtLeastOnce);
/// ```
