//! [`CredentialRef`] — a reference to a secret, never the secret itself (D81).
//!
//! Auth for an MCP server (API keys, OAuth tokens) is supplied **out-of-band**: a
//! `CredentialRef` names a host environment variable (or, later, a cloud
//! secret-broker key); the secret *value* is read transiently at transport-setup
//! time and handed to the child process's environment. The value is never stored on
//! any struct, never placed in an `EffectRequest`, a `BrokerHandle`, the journal, a
//! `MoteId`, or a `StepRecord`. `Debug`/`Display` print only the *identity* (the
//! variable name), so a logged credential ref never leaks the secret.
