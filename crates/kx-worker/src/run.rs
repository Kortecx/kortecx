/// lives behind the broker (`ModelBroker` runs prompt-carrying ROND Motes); in
/// serve it lives behind the EXECUTOR (`ModelRouterExecutor`, whose react arm
/// decodes + fences the output pre-commit), so the distributed mirror is a
/// direct `executor.run`. Dispatch semantics match `run_wm`'s
/// `IdempotentByConstruction` arm: fire directly (no `EffectStaged` — a greedy
/// decode is serve-once via the coordinator's first-wins commit dedup, R49) and
/// propose the staged `result_ref`. Warrant ceilings are enforced INSIDE the
