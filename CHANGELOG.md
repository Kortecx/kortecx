# Changelog

All notable changes to kortecx are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). kortecx is in early
development; interfaces may change before 1.0 — pin a commit if you build on it.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Live tool-calling for runtime-dialed MCP connectors.** An external connector
  registered at runtime (`kx connections add` / `flow().with_mcp(...)` /
  `RegisterMcpServer`) is now reliably callable by the autonomous loop: the tool-call
  parser also accepts a bare paren call (`server/tool(arg="…")`) some local models
  emit, and a model that names a tool ambiguously (a bare leaf shared by two connected
  servers, e.g. two `echo` tools) gets a precise, disambiguating re-prompt naming the
  full `server/tool` ids instead of the chain silently stalling. A dead-lettered
  agentic turn now always reports a reason (the last refusal, a spent budget, or a
  dispatch failure) instead of a blank terminal. **`kx connections fire --name <server>
  --tool <remote> --args '<json>'`** (and `kx.connections.fire(...)` / `connections.fire(...)`
  in the Python/TypeScript SDKs, plus a per-connector **Fire a tool** panel in the
  console) exercises one registered tool live through the broker — a model-free "does
  this connector work" check (it validates args against the tool's schema and enforces
  the same grant gate; it is a diagnostic, not a recorded run). (serve/tools/SDK/CLI/UI/docs)

- **Gemma-4-12B omni support + model-agnostic prompt templating.** A model-serving
  gateway now formats every model with its OWN chat template — applying the GGUF's
  embedded template through llama.cpp where it renders, with a built-in
  per-architecture fallback (`ChatML` / Gemma) for models llama.cpp cannot render
  (such as Gemma-4) — so a model is never fed another model's format. A recipe's
  structured reply is normalized symmetrically: a leading reasoning block
  (`<think>` or Gemma's reasoning channel) or a Markdown JSON code fence around a
  plan / tool-call envelope is stripped before the fail-closed parse. Pull and serve
  the recommended local model (Apache-2.0, text + image) with `just
  fetch-gemma-model` and `just review-serve-gemma`. (serve/inference/docs)
- **Data Lab — a multi-modal asset viewer + the datasets keystone.** Committed run
  artifacts and retrieval hits now render **inline in the browser** by kind: images,
  video, and audio (from a `blob:` object URL — never a remote `src`, so no
  outbound-fetch surface), markdown (React-element rendering, never `innerHTML`), JSON
  and text (read-only Monaco), with a bounded hex preview + byte-accurate download for
  anything else. The Datasets section is reframed as the **Data Lab** with a top-k
  slider, a `content_ref` chip, and a click-to-expand hit detail that renders through
  the shared viewer. A new **`kx datasets` CLI** (`list` / `ingest` / `query`, with
  `--json`) exposes the RAG data-plane, mirrored by the Python and TypeScript SDKs.
  (serve/cli/sdk/ui/docs)
- **`FuzzyDiscovery` — advisory fuzzy-in / exact-out retrieval (Slice-B).** A new
  additive RPC over a dataset's vector index that returns only content-addressed refs
  + a display-only basis-point score (SN-8 — never an identity input); resolve bytes by
  the exact ref. Exposed in the Python/TypeScript SDKs and an advisory "Discover" mode
  in the Data Lab. (serve/sdk/ui)

### Changed

- **The bootstrap demo team is now a workspace team** (`kx/teams/workspace`) whose
  members are the real configured parties (the `--auth-token` parties + the
  `local-dev` dev principal) — no fabricated/demo identity. **Upgrade note:** on a
  REUSED `kx serve` data dir the old `kx/teams/demo` rows are orphaned (the
  membership/grant ledgers are append-only and never delete), so both the old demo
  team and the new workspace team appear until the data dir is reset — a **fresh data
  dir is recommended** on upgrade. (gateway/UI)
- **`kx/recipes/fanout-demo` is renamed `kx/recipes/passthrough-dag`** — an honest
  multi-node fan-out → gather DAG whose every node passes its real input through.

### Removed

- **Demo scaffolding (Golden Rule 15 — real-model integrity).** The `kx submit --demo`
  CLI verb, the `kx/recipes/exec-demo` recipe (and its `KX_DEMO_BODY_PATH` override),
  and the fabricated `"kx demo result for mote …"` placeholder are gone. Every runnable
  surface now produces **real** output — an honest deterministic passthrough for PURE
  steps, or real on-device model inference for model recipes. Use `kx invoke
  kx/recipes/echo` (or any published blueprint) instead of `kx submit --demo`. The
  platform sandbox machinery is retained as a stable seam for a future tools/scripts
  capability.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-06-10

A patch release from the clean-install verification campaign — two bugs caught
by testing the **installed** runtime end-to-end across all four surfaces (CLI,
Python SDK, TypeScript SDK, UI).

### Fixed

- **Morphic Data Engine: capture records are now correctly stamped with the run
  instance** (was all-zeros in a real `kx serve`). The serve-path capture poller
  folds the journal in ~250 ms ticks; the run instance is now persisted durably
  (`capture.db` `run_meta`, schema v1→v2) so an action committed in any later tick
  is stamped, not only one folded in the same tick as `RunRegistered`. `capture.db`
  is a rebuildable cache, so an old sidecar drops-and-rebuilds on first open.
  (gateway; OSS #172)
- **SDKs: `invoke(wait=True)` on `kx/recipes/react` no longer spuriously times
  out.** A ReAct chain has no statically-known terminal Mote (the run-salted
  turn-0 id is server-derived), so both SDKs now wait on chain **settlement via
  `ListReactTurns`** (answer → committed, dead-lettered → failed). Drive a react
  run's completion from a client/UI via `ListReactTurns`/events. (Python +
  TypeScript SDKs; OSS #173)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-10

The first public release: a single-system durable agentic-execution runtime
(`kx run` / `kx serve`) with the live agentic loop (plan, re-plan, critic,
ReAct-with-tools), the Morphic Data Engine (durable serve-path capture), the
Datasets/RAG data-plane, teams/grants viewers, a React+Vite console, and
Python + TypeScript client SDKs. Install the FFI-free `kx` binary via
`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kortecx/kortecx/main/scripts/install.sh | sh`
(SHA-256-verified prebuilt for linux-x86_64 / linux-aarch64 / macos-arm64), or
`cargo install --path crates/kx-cli` from source. The canonical demo digest is
`7d22d4bdfc6f68a4311f40b20f3fe7c67f4c5d2b352f3bff8722b439e94a5af9` (exactly-once
across a clean run and a crash-then-replay). Highlights since the pre-release
work — the entries below were developed under `[Unreleased]` and ship in 0.1.0:

### Added

- **Morphic Data Engine — durable serve-path capture** (`crates/kx-gateway`,
  `crates/kx-gateway-core`, `crates/kx-proto`, SDKs). On-by-default step capture
  (`kx-capture`) previously ran ONLY in the single-node `kx run` engine and held
  its records in memory; `kx serve` captured nothing. It now logs in serve: a
  background poll-fold of the gateway's **read-only** journal handle into a
  durable `capture.db` sidecar under `--catalog-dir` — off the sole-writer commit
  path (zero added commit latency; the canonical digest `7d22d4bd…` is
  byte-invariant, I1.c-proven) and off the truth path (a **rebuildable cache**:
  on a stale schema, a torn DB, or a deleted sidecar it drops-and-rebuilds from
  the journal, which stays truth — D40). Records are **join-key-only** by
  construction (the schema has no payload/reasoning columns — the privacy-safe
  ActionsOnly scope made structural; `Full` stays code-gated): a committed Mote's
  `mote_id` / `instance_id` / `result_ref` / `nd_class` / `seq`, plus the ReAct
  `turn`/`branch` joined from the chain's off-DAG `ReactRound` facts. Queryable
  via the additive read-only **`ListCaptureRecords`** RPC (instance-scoped,
  paginated, newest-first) and the new `list_capture_records` wrappers in both
  SDKs. The capture ledger lives in the `kx-gateway` host (the dep walls forbid
  `kx-capture` in `kx-gateway-core`); gateway-core gets only a capture-free
  `CaptureView` seam. `rusqlite` (already in the default closure via
  kx-catalog/kx-fleet; pure-Rust C, not the llama.cpp FFI) is now a direct
  non-optional dependency. FFI-free build unaffected.

- **SDK ReAct / re-plan / capture queryability + v0.1.0** (`bindings/python`,
  `bindings/typescript`, all crates). `ListReactTurns` / `ListReplanRounds` /
  `ListCaptureRecords` gained high-level client wrappers (Python sync + async;
  TypeScript) with frozen page types and from-proto tests — the UI extension can
  now surface a chain's Reason→Act→Observe history, a run's re-plan rounds, and
  the action exhaust. All crates bumped `0.0.1` → `0.1.0` for the first public
  release; a new `just features-guard` keeps the installed-binary feature matrix
  (`--features hnsw`, `--features inference,hnsw`) buildable + FFI-free.

- **Live ReAct TOOL FIRING in `kx serve` (PR-2d-2, react-tools-live)**
  (`crates/kx-mcp`, `crates/kx-coordinator`, `crates/kx-worker`,
  `crates/kx-gateway`, `crates/kx-gateway-core`, `crates/kx-projection`,
  `crates/kx-proto`, `crates/kx-profile`). The PR-2d-1 answer-only fence is
  replaced by the live tool round: a committed turn that proposes a
  warrant-granted tool now has its decision **validated at the freeze** (the
  sole-writer settle resolves the tool against the registry and checks the args
  against its typed `inputSchema`, fail-closed — a frozen `Tool` fact is always
  fireable), then the coordinator **materializes the OBSERVATION Mote**
  (byte-identical to the harness `react_tool_mote_salted`, cross-impl golden
  pinned on both sides of the dep wall) whose commit gates the next turn — the
  harness fire-then-bound order, crash-flavor guard included (a reaped worker's
  late observation commit still advances the chain). Args travel **out-of-band**
  of the Mote identity: an additive `WorkItem.tool_args` carries the
  coordinator-validated `(args_bytes, net_scope)`, **re-derived at every
  (re-)lease as a pure function of committed facts** (nothing staged, crash-safe
  by construction); the worker consumes it into the `EffectRequest` and
  **refuses to fire a granted tool without args** (terminal, F4). The first
  `kx-gateway→kx-mcp` edge lands as an OPTIONAL dep behind `inference` (the
  dep wall moves it from FORBIDDEN to the hnsw-style optional-edge proof), with
  a new bundled deterministic stdio tool (`[[bin]] kx-mcp-echo`, `mcp-echo@1`,
  no egress) registered on the serve broker, and **`kx/recipes/react`**
  (free-params `instruction`/`max_turns`/`max_tool_calls`, validated
  `0 < max_tool_calls < max_turns ≤ 8`; the durable anchor records the bound
  caps) provisioned under the SERVER-constructed tool-granting react warrant —
  the first non-empty `tool_grants` in serve. Admission hardening: `SubmitRun`
  now **refuses any client warrant carrying `tool_grants`** (tool authority is
  server-issued only — the red-team BLOCKER #5 / Morphic finding), refuses
  `react_seed` on a serve without the inference executor (the
  `critics_supported` twin), and `Invoke` refuses a recipe granting a tool the
  broker never registered. The F-7 react trajectory now interleaves
  observations in transcript order (`[turn0, obs0, turn1, …]`). `kx-projection`
  gains a DERIVED per-instance `react_rounds` index (+ a react-turn-Mote set)
  — settle/recover/trajectory reads are now per-chain, closing the PR-2d-1
  O(runs²) finding at the source; the index is never serialized (checkpoint
  stays **v4**; `encode_state` and the canonical demo digest `7d22d4bd…` are
  byte-invariant; **no journal schema bump** — observations commit as ordinary
  entries). `kx-profile` gains M7a (react answer-settle) + M7b (full tool round
  firing the real bundled tool) spikes. The worker gains the **react-turn
  routing arm** the substrate was missing in a real serve: a coordinator-
  materialized TURN (ROND, the identity-bearing marker, no `tool_contract`)
  dispatches directly through the hosted executor (whose react arm decodes +
  fences pre-commit) — previously every non-PURE Mote routed to the capability
  broker, so a live react turn could never reach the model (caught by the new
  `react_serve` e2e, the first to drive the chain through the real serve stack:
  Invoke → real Qwen3 inference per turn → settle → `Answer` via
  `ListReactTurns`).

- **Live ReAct substrate in `kx serve` (PR-2d-1, answer-only)** (`crates/kx-toolcall`
  NEW, `crates/kx-journal`, `crates/kx-projection`, `crates/kx-coordinator`,
  `crates/kx-gateway`, `crates/kx-gateway-core`, `crates/kx-model-harness`). The
  harness ReAct loop's substrate now runs LIVE: a `SubmitMoteSpec.react_seed` flag
  (additive, default-false) makes the coordinator swap in a **run-salted** turn-0
  model Mote (`blake3("kx-react-turn" ‖ instance_id ‖ turn)` — server-derived
  identity, collision-free in serve's shared journal) and anchor a durable
  **`ReactRound`** fact (journal schema **v7→v8**, kind 9; off-DAG, never a digest
  input) recording the chain's base prompt, warrant, and budget caps. The
  sole-writer coordinator settles each committed turn by decoding its RAW output
  through the new **`kx-toolcall`** pure leaf (the tool-call authority gate,
  EXTRACTED from `kx-model-harness` so the gateway fence, the coordinator settle,
  and the harness loop share ONE implementation), freezes the branch
  (`Answer`/`Tool`/`DeadLettered`/`Pending`) as a durable fact, advances the chain
  under the fold-re-derived budget (the harness `>=`/tool-then-turn gate,
  line-for-line), and serves the trajectory to the next turn via the F-7 seam in
  transcript order. Crash recovery re-derives the whole chain from committed facts
  alone (the in-flight turn rebuilds to the SAME salted identity — R49; committed
  turns are served, never re-sampled). The gateway's model router gains a
  `react_turn` arm: raw-commit on a normal completion, fail-closed on a malformed
  proposal, and an **answer-only fence** that dead-letters any tool proposal (tool
  *firing* lands in PR-2d-2). New read-only `ListReactTurns` RPC (instance-scoped,
  paginated) mirrors `ListReplanRounds`. Checkpoint format **v3→v4** (carries
  `react_rounds`; a v3 sidecar is refused and recovery full-folds, self-healing).
  Journal v7→v8 is a pure pass-through migration; the canonical demo digest
  `7d22d4bd…` is byte-invariant; the dep walls now also forbid `kx-model-harness`
  and `kx-mcp` below the gateway line.

- **GPU/Metal + decoding tuning for the in-process backend** (`crates/kx-llamacpp`).
  Env-driven knobs applied inside `ModelParams::new` / `ContextParams::new` — the
  exact constructors the runtime's dispatch path already calls — so they take effect
  with **no edit to the frozen trio**: `KX_N_GPU_LAYERS` (now **all layers offload to
  Metal by default on Apple**, CPU elsewhere — CUDA stays cloud-only, D28),
  `KX_FLASH_ATTN` (`auto`/`on`/`off`), `KX_KV_TYPE` (`f16`/`q8_0`), `KX_N_THREADS`.
  New `ContextParams::with_flash_attn`/`with_type_k`/`with_type_v` builders +
  `FlashAttn`/`KvCacheType`. Unset env = llama.cpp defaults (byte-identical; the
  determinism smoke + canonical digest are preserved). `just metal-smoke` witnesses
  real offload.
- **Qwen3 agent-model integration** (`crates/kx-model-harness`, `crates/kx-model-store`,
  `crates/kx-planner`). The model name is now configurable (`KX_MODEL_NAME`; default
  unchanged for identity stability); a fail-soft GGUF metadata reader
  (`kx_model_store::read_context_length`) lets the runtime size `n_ctx` to the model;
  a `register_kortecx` helper builds the model's `ModelDescriptor` +
  `ProvidedCapabilities` and asserts the validator returns `TypeOk` (Apache-2.0, Text,
  native tool-calling). The strict tool-call (`kx-model-harness`) and plan
  (`kx-planner`) decoders now tolerate a leading Qwen3 `<think>…</think>` reasoning
  block (leading-block-only — the fail-closed strict parse and SN-8 exact-grant
  matching are unchanged). `just fetch-agent-model` fetches a public Qwen3 stand-in.
- **Live model dispatch in `kx serve` (AL1, opt-in)** (`crates/kx-gateway`,
  `crates/kx-cli`). Built `--features inference`, the embedded worker runs **real
  model Motes** through the in-process llama.cpp backend: the new `kx/recipes/chat`
  recipe ChatML-wraps a `prompt` free-param, greedy-decodes, and commits the
  completion exactly-once. Composes the existing public `InferenceBackend` surface —
  **the frozen trio is untouched** — behind a `MoteExecutor` the gateway owns, and is
  **off by default** so the default `kx` stays FFI-free (the `build-no-inference` gate
  + the dep-wall stay green).
- **`frozen-trio` CI guard** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). A PR whose diff touches
  `kx-inference`/`kx-executor`/`kx-scheduler` `src/` fails the gate — the thesis test
  (layers-on-top must not edit the kernel) is now enforced, not just promised.

- **Real, sandboxed Mote body-execution in `kx serve`** (`crates/kx-gateway`).
  The embedded worker now runs a real Mote body inside the platform sandbox
  (bubblewrap on Linux, sandbox-exec on macOS) for the new `kx/recipes/exec-demo`
  recipe — materializing the body from its `logic_ref`, running it under the
  warrant's scope, and reconciling its output into the content store so the run
  commits exactly-once. The demo `echo` path and the canonical projection digest
  are unchanged (the frozen trio `kx-executor`/`kx-scheduler`/`kx-inference` is
  untouched — the gateway composes their existing public API). **Fail-closed:** a
  sandbox that cannot run errors rather than executing on the host. The runtime
  image ships `bubblewrap` + the demo body; real-exec under the hardened
  `docker-compose` is a documented `seccomp=unconfined` opt-in (Docker's default
  seccomp blocks the unprivileged user namespace bubblewrap needs).

## [0.1.0] — the reachable runtime

The first release where the durable runtime is **reachable end to end**: a server,
a CLI, recipes, an audit trail, and a live event stream, on top of the
exactly-once durability spine.

### Added

- **`kx` CLI** — one FFI-free binary (`crates/kx-cli`). `run`/`replay`/`digest`
  drive the engine locally; `serve` hosts the gateway; `invoke`/`submit`/
  `projection`/`content`/`events`/`signatures` are gRPC clients of a running
  gateway. Agent-ergonomic `--wait` runs the runtime like a function and returns
  one committed result; `--json` everywhere; a typed exit-code contract
  (`0` ok / `2` usage / `3` wait-timeout-resumable / `1` rpc+io).
- **Gateway server** — `kx serve` hosts the `KxGateway` gRPC service over an
  embedded coordinator + local worker (`crates/kx-gateway`, `crates/kx-gateway-core`).
  Bearer-token auth with **deny-all default** and **server-derived identity**;
  `--dev-allow-local` for loopback development.
- **Inbound recipe execution** — `Invoke` binds a published recipe by handle to
  JSON args and runs it to a committed terminal Mote, exactly-once
  (`crates/kx-invoke`).
- **Recipe library + prompt templating** — five reusable, deterministic recipes
  (`map_reduce`, `fan_out_gather`, `retry_until_critic`, `react_tool_loop`,
  `image_batch_describe_reduce`) and a pure, fail-closed prompt-template engine
  (`crates/kx-workflow`).
- **Audit trail** — an off-truth-path, best-effort JSONL audit sink that records
  the run lifecycle without ever touching the projection digest
  (`crates/kx-audit`); enabled with `kx run --audit-log <path>`.
- **Live event stream** — `StreamEvents` is a true resumable live tail, with a
  WebSocket bridge; `kx events --follow` consumes it and auto-resumes.
- **Durable catalog & fleets** — a sharable signature/recipe catalog with durable
  SQLite-backed ledgers (`crates/kx-catalog`) and team/fleet membership
  (`crates/kx-fleet`).
- **Tiered install automation** — `just setup` (FFI-free), `just setup-inference`
  (opt-in native backend), `just fetch-demo-model` (SHA-256-verified GGUF), a
  tiered `just doctor` with per-OS install hints, and `just verify-quickstart`
  (a docs-as-test gate that runs the README quickstart and asserts the canonical
  digest).
- **Documentation** — a production-grade README (quick start → serve → inspect),
  refreshed `GLOSSARY.md`, and this changelog.

### Guarantees (carried from the durability spine)

- A world-mutating step takes effect **exactly once** across crashes, retries, and
  redistribution.
- All live state is a **pure fold** of an append-only journal; recovery re-folds
  the log. Cold re-fold of a 25k-Mote journal stays sub-linear (gated in CI).
- The `kx` binary installs with **Rust only** — no C++ toolchain (proven by a
  dependency-wall test and an FFI-free CI build job). llama.cpp is opt-in for local
  inference.

### Known limitations

Plaintext gRPC (front with TLS for non-loopback); bearer-token auth with no
multi-tenant isolation yet; single-system journal writer; single-stream inference
with model-by-path (no registry); audit-log + event-stream observability (no
metrics/OTel export yet). See the README's *Production notes & known limitations*.
